# Quiz App

A Trivia Quiz application created in <strong>Next.JS with <strong>TypeScript</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>.<br>
Unit tests provided through the <strong>Jest</strong> test framwork. <br>

The goal is to answer all of the 10 questions correctly.<br>
The player has 15 seconds to answer each question. When the time is up for a question, the question is considered unanswered.<br>
The player has two lifelines, one called “50/50” that removes two incorrect answers, and one called “+10 s” that gives the player ten extra seconds for the current question. Each lifeline can only be used once during a game.
